# CheckUP Health

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

CheckUP Health aims to provide users with a few things.  First is the ability to track their feelings/symtoms/medications etc so that those vital details can be easily recalled during healthcare facility visits.  

Second is the ability to have the most recent worldwide data for COVID-19 available at their fingertips.  Cases, deaths, and recoveries for all countries are presented to the user and are able to be updated depending on country selected.

And lastly is the ability to use a chatbot to perform a COVID-19 screening test on the user, to help determine whether quartantine is advised, or seeking out professional healthcare advice is needed to further conclude testing.
